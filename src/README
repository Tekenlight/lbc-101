This is an arbitrary precision library extracted from GNU bc-1.07,
available at http://www.gnu.org/software/bc/ .

This code is subject to GNU GPL. See COPYING.

The file number.c has been changed slightly to fix a memory leak.
My config.h disables code unnecessary for my needs.
Here are the differences:

% diff bc-1.07.1/lib/number.c ./number.c
